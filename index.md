## Space Bastards: An Overview of Men's Club Ultimate, Spring 2019

### Introduction
Frisbee has become a staple, if not a cliche, of the college experience.  For most, itâ€™s just throwing a disc around on campus green spaces.  For others, it is a sport that hours of hardwork, dedication, sweat, and tears are poured into over four years, maybe even five.  Club Ultimate Frisbee takes the casual games and tossing that pop up sporadically to the next level.  Practicing up to eight hours a week, spending time outside of practice working out at the gym or getting in reps with a disc, traveling hundreds of miles away to compete against other schools all are essential parts of the club ultimate experience at the University of Maryland.  

The men's team at UMD is, for some unknown reason, named the Space Bastards.  To help them strategize and develop players, they made use of UltiAnalytics, a site that can track individual and team frisbee stats throughout the season.  They filmed all their games this semester, in order to rewatch them to either learn about opposing teams or collect their own stats and input them into the UltiAnalytics system.  Positive stats include goals and assists.  Negative stats include throwawys (throwing a disc to someone who doesn't catch it) and turnovers, which include drops and stalls (losing the disc because you held it for longer than 10 seconds).  All of these components come together to create a picture, through data, of the team's strengths and weaknesses.

For many, data science may seem only important or applicable to large companies, government agencies, or academic endeavors.  Throughout this tutorial, we hope to show that anyone, even college students, can use data science to learn about the world around them and better their experiences.  In particular, this analysis and tutorial serves as an example for other college teams to make the most of their stats, find their goals improve their performance on the field.


### The Question

In our experiment, we asked:

_"Do better players actually get more playing time?"_

While someone may seem to be very skilled in practice, therefore gaining them playing time during tournaments, stats show us if it translates onto the field come game time.  It would be unfortunate if unrecognized, good players were overlooked or if overstated players were relied on too heavily, taking up playing time when they should be benched or developed more.  Specifically, we focused on player performance while on offense.  Through this analysis, we aimed to determine the relationship between offensive stats and playing time.

### Data Curation

Retrieving this data was simple.  The team has been personally building this dataset up over the past few months.  Collecting the data just required us to download it from [UltiAnalytics](https://www.ultianalytics.com/details.html).

Here are some terms concerning our dataset that you should know going forward:
 - Action: any drop, stall, turn, assist or goal
 - Playing time: how many points a player participated in during the season.  This is not a measure of time (like minutes or hours) a player spent on the field, but rather how many times he was one of the seven people put on the line at the beginnning of a point.

### Parsing and Data Management
Once we had it, we had to do a lot of cleaning and maniupulation to make the data usable, as it was not in the same format that it appeared in on the very user-friendly site.  Columns needed to be renamed.

The biggest portion of this step was dedicated to calculating the Plus-Minus value for each player on the team, the means with which we were able to rank all the players from best to worst.  Plus-Minus is a mechanism that takes positive actions on the field and balances them against negative actions on the field.  A coach or captain can put into the system how many drops or turns a player was responsible for, as well as their goals and assists.  Drops, turns, and stalls each count as -1, while goals and assists count as +1.  All these actions are added together to create the player's Plus-Minus score.
